## 3. Advanced Multi-Select Actions

### Pattern-Rule Interactions
- **Drag-and-drop multiple patterns** onto one or more rules in the UI
- **Smart pattern merging** when adding multiple patterns with overlap
- **Pattern impact analysis** showing how adding patterns affects rule behavior
- **Hierarchical selection** (select a tag to select all patterns with that tag)
- **Mass pattern conversions** (convert selection from glob to regex or vice versa)

### Rule-Ruleset Interactions
- **Rule priority batch adjustment** with visual reordering
- **Conditional enabling** of rules (enable these rules only when another is enabled)
- **Rule contribution view** showing how each selected rule contributes to the ruleset
- **Batch destination path modification** with template support (e.g., replace path segment)
- **Rule cloning with pattern preservation** across rulesets

### Global Selection Features
- **Selection groups** (save selections for later reuse)
- **Selection filtering** by properties (e.g., "select all disabled rules")
- **Selection inversion** to toggle current selection
- **Progressive selection** (select items matching criteria of current selection)
- **Smart selection** based on usage patterns and relationships

## 4. Selection UI Enhancements

### Visual Indicators
- **Clear visual highlighting** of selected items with contrasting colors
- **Selection count badge** showing number of currently selected items
- **"Mixed state" indicators** when only some child items are selected
- **Relationship highlighting** showing connections between selected items
- **Bulk edit mode** with specialized interface for mass operations

### Selection Tools
- **Selection history** with undo/redo for selection actions
- **Rectangular selection** for grid views (click and drag)
- **Selection by tag** or other metadata
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for selection operations (Select All, Invert Selection)
- **Search-based selection** ("select all matching...")

## 5. Implementation Considerations

1. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with basic multi-select operations (delete, enable/disable)
   - Add more complex operations over time based on user needs
   - Ensure all operations have undo/redo support

2. **Selection State Management**
   - Store selection state separately from data models
   - Handle large selections efficiently (avoid performance issues)
   - Clear selections when changing views or after operations

3. **Feedback and Confirmation**
   - Show clear preview of multi-item operations before execution
   - Provide robust confirmation dialogs with item counts and impact
   - Show success/failure feedback after batch operations

4. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure keyboard selection modes (Shift+Arrow, etc.)
   - Support screen reader announcements of selection changes
   - Provide alternative methods to context menus (keyboard shortcuts)

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize UI rendering for large selections
   - Use virtualized lists for large data sets
   - Consider background processing for operations on many items

These multi-select and context menu behaviors significantly enhance TaskMover's usability, especially for power users managing many patterns, rules, and rulesets. They balance efficiency with discoverability and make complex batch operations intuitive.

# UI Design Changes for TaskMover's New Features

To accommodate the new pattern, rule, and ruleset architecture, TaskMover's UI needs significant adjustments. Below are detailed recommendations for modifying the UI to support these new features while maintaining usability.

## 1. Main Application Structure

### Navigation System

```
+---------------------------------------+
|  TaskMover                       [≡]  |
+---------------------------------------+
|                                       |
| +-----+ +------+ +--------+ +-------+ |
| |Rules| |Patterns| |Rulesets| |History| |
| +-----+ +------+ +--------+ +-------+ |
|                                       |
|  [Content Area]                       |
|                                       |
+---------------------------------------+
|  Status Bar                           |
+---------------------------------------+
```

- **Tab-based Navigation**: Use tabs for the main sections (Rules, Patterns, Rulesets, History)
- **Persistent Sidebar**: Add a collapsible sidebar for quick access to frequently used items
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Show context (e.g., "Rulesets > Work Files > Edit Rule")

           "category": "advanced",
           "ui_name": "Worker Threads",
           "description": "Number of parallel operations",
           "requires_restart": True
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Settings Profile Management**
   ```python
   class ProfileManager:
       def __init__(self, settings_manager):
           self.settings_manager = settings_manager
           
       def create_profile(self, name, base_profile=None):
           """Create a new profile based on existing one or defaults"""
           
       def switch_profile(self, name):
           """Switch to a different profile"""
           
       def import_profile(self, path):
           """Import profile from file"""
           
       def export_profile(self, name, path):
           """Export profile to file"""
   ```

#### B. Settings UI Components

1. **Dynamic Settings Panel Generator**
   ```python
   class SettingsPanelFactory:
       def __init__(self, settings_manager):
           self.settings_manager = settings_manager
           
       def create_panel(self, category, parent):
           """Create a settings panel for a category"""
           panel = tk.Frame(parent)
           settings = self.settings_manager.get_for_category(category)
           
           for setting in settings:
               # Create appropriate widget based on setting type
               # Connect widget to settings value
               # Add validation
               # Add help tooltip
           
           return panel
   ```

2. **Settings Search Implementation**
   ```python
   class SettingsSearch:
       def __init__(self, settings_manager):
           self.settings_manager = settings_manager
           
       def search(self, query):
           """Search settings by name, description, or value"""
           results = []
           schema = self.settings_manager.schema
           
           for key, info in schema.items():
               if (query.lower() in key.lower() or 
                   query.lower() in info["ui_name"].lower() or
                   query.lower() in info["description"].lower()):
                   results.append(key)
                   
           return results
   ```

3. **Advanced Property Grid**
   ```python
   class PropertyGrid:
       """Advanced property grid for power users"""
       def __init__(self, parent, settings_manager):
           self.settings_manager = settings_manager
           self.grid = ttk.Treeview(parent, columns=("Property", "Value", "Info"))
           
       def populate(self, category=None):
           """Fill grid with settings"""
           settings = self.settings_manager.get_all()
           for key, value in settings.items():
               if category and not key.startswith(category):
                   continue
               schema_info = self.settings_manager.schema.get(key, {})
               display_name = schema_info.get("ui_name", key)
               self.grid.insert("", "end", values=(key, value, "🛈"))
   ```

#### C. Settings Validation and Type Safety

1. **Type-Based Validators**
   ```python
   class SettingsValidator:
       """Validates setting values against schema"""
       
       VALIDATORS = {
           "string": lambda v, s: isinstance(v, str) and len(v) <= s.get("max_length", float("inf")),
           "integer": lambda v, s: isinstance(v, int) and s.get("min", float("-inf")) <= v <= s.get("max", float("inf")),
           "float": lambda v, s: isinstance(v, (int, float)) and s.get("min", float("-inf")) <= v <= s.get("max", float("inf")),
           "boolean": lambda v, _: isinstance(v, bool),
           "enum": lambda v, s: v in s.get("values", []),
           "color": lambda v, _: re.match(r"^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$", v) is not None,
           "path": lambda v, _: os.path.exists(v) or s.get("must_exist", True) is False,
           "json": lambda v, _: True  # Custom validation inside
       }
       
       @classmethod
       def validate(cls, key, value, schema):
           """Validate a value against schema definition"""
           if key not in schema:
               return True  # No schema, no validation
               
           setting_schema = schema[key]
           validator = cls.VALIDATORS.get(setting_schema["type"])
           
           if validator:
               return validator(value, setting_schema)
           return True
   ```

2. **Settings Change Subscription**
   ```python
   class SettingsObserver:
       """Allow components to subscribe to settings changes"""
       
       def __init__(self, settings_manager):

           self.callbacks = {}
           settings_manager.add_change_listener(self._on_setting_changed)
           
       def subscribe(self, setting_key, callback):
           """Subscribe to changes of a specific setting"""
           if setting_key not in self.callbacks:
               self.callbacks[setting_key] = []
           self.callbacks[setting_key].append(callback)
           
       def _on_setting_changed(self, key, old_value, new_value):
           """Notify callbacks when setting changes"""
           if key in self.callbacks:
               for callback in self.callbacks[key]:
                   callback(key, old_value, new_value)
   ```

       def migrate_from_version(self, old_version):
           """Migrate settings from an older version"""
           current_version = self.settings_manager.get("app.settings_version")
           
           if old_version < "2.0" and current_version >= "2.0":
               # Migrate pre-2.0 settings
               self._migrate_pre_2_0()
               
       def _migrate_pre_2_0(self):
           """Example migration from pre-2.0 format"""
           # Old settings used "conflict_mode", new uses "conflict.resolution"
           old_mode = self.settings_manager.get("conflict_mode")
           if old_mode:
               # Map old values to new values
               mapping = {
                   "ask_user": "ask",

           with open(file_path, "w") as f:
               json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
               
       def import_all(self, file_path):
           """Import settings from file"""
           with open(file_path, "r") as f:
               data = json.load(f)
               
           # Validate version compatibility
           imported_version = data.get("settings_version")
           if self._is_compatible_version(imported_version):
               # Import profiles
               for name, profile in data.get("profiles", {}).items():
                   self.settings_manager.profiles[name] = profile
                   
               # Set active profile if specified
               if "active_profile" in data and data["active_profile"] in self.settings_manager.profiles:
                   self.settings_manager.switch_profile(data["active_profile"])
                   
       def export_category(self, category, file_path):
           """Export only settings from a specific category"""
           settings = {}
           all_settings = self.settings_manager.get_all()
           
           for key, value in all_settings.items():
               if key.startswith(f"{category}."):
                   settings[key] = value
                   
           with open(file_path, "w") as f:
