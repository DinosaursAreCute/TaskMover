# Pattern System Implementation Checklist

## Core Pattern Management
- [ ] Create `Pattern` class with properties for ID, name, description, and match criteria
- [ ] Implement basic pattern matching using glob patterns
- [ ] Add support for regular expression pattern matching 
- [ ] Implement pattern validation mechanism

- [ ] 

## Advanced Pattern Features
