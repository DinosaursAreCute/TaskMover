# TaskMover Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the TaskMover redesign, categorized by component and priority. The plan follows a "UI-First" approach, starting with mockups before moving to core functionality.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Critical components that must be implemented first
- **P1**: High priority components needed early in the development cycle
- **P2**: Medium priority components to be implemented after core functionality
- **P3**: Lower priority components that can be added later

## Phase 1: UI Mockups

- [ ] Develop storage abstraction layer

### 2.2 File Operations Engine (P0)
- [ ] Create file system interaction abstraction
- [ ] Implement safe file operation wrappers
- [ ] Add operation tracking mechanism
- [ ] Build history recording system
- [ ] Implement undo/redo capability

### 2.3 Pattern Matching Engine (P0)
- [ ] Implement glob pattern matching
- [ ] Add regex pattern support
- [ ] Create content-based matching framework
- [ ] Build pattern testing framework
- [ ] Add pattern validation

### 2.4 Conflict Resolution System (P1)
- [ ] Develop conflict detection logic
- [ ] Implement resolution strategy framework
- [ ] Connect resolution UI to backend
- [ ] Add batch resolution capabilities
- [ ] Create resolution history tracking

### 2.5 Settings Management System (P1)
- [ ] Implement settings storage and retrieval
- [ ] Create profile management functionality
- [ ] Add import/export capability
- [ ] Build settings validation framework
- [ ] Implement settings migration for backward compatibility

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Refinements

### 3.1 Advanced Pattern Features (P2)
- [ ] Add support for dynamic pattern tokens
- [ ] Implement pattern categories and tagging
- [ ] Create smart pattern builder
- [ ] Add pattern relationship mapping

### 3.2 Enhanced Rule Management (P2)
- [ ] Implement multi-relationship model

- [ ] Add multi-threading support

### 3.5 Integration and Extensibility (P3)
- [ ] Design plugin system architecture
- [ ] Implement API layer
- [ ] Add external storage providers support
- [ ] Create custom actions framework
- [ ] Build webhook notification system

### 3.6 Security and Compliance (P3)
- [ ] Implement permission verification
- [ ] Add safe mode
- [ ] Create audit trail functionality
- [ ] Build sensitive data detection
- [ ] Implement compliance profiles

### 3.7 Testing and Validation Tools (P2)
- [ ] Create rule validation tools
- [ ] Build simulation environment
- [ ] Implement pattern testing tools
- [ ] Add configuration linting
- [ ] Create performance benchmarking tools

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **UI-First Development**: Focus on getting the UI mockups functional before implementing backend logic
2. **Iterative Testing**: Test each component as it's developed
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation alongside code
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure settings and data migration is considered early

## Development Process

1. Complete all P0 UI mockups
2. Implement P0 core functionality
3. Connect UI mockups to core functionality
4. Move to P1 components
5. Add P2 features
6. Finally implement P3 features if time allows

By following this plan, we ensure a structured approach to the complete redesign of TaskMover with a focus on creating a maintainable, extensible architecture.
