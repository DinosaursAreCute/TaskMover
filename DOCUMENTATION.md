# TaskMover Documentation

## Whatâ€™s New in 2.0.0

- Major UI and UX improvements for rule management and settings.
- Full test automation for settings, dummy file creation, UI integration, themes, and color application.
- Colorful, detailed test logging for all automated tests.
- Expanded documentation and test case coverage.
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the application.
- Enhanced theme and color customization for the UI.
- Added developer tools and advanced logging for debugging.
- Improved compatibility with Windows and cross-platform environments.

## [2025-05-15] Codebase and Test Improvements

- The `load_settings` function now strictly validates the settings file and raises a `RuntimeError` if the file is invalid or missing required keys.
- UI tests are automatically skipped in headless environments (when no display is available), making CI and remote testing more robust.
- The test suite was refactored for better compatibility with Tkinter/ttkbootstrap and to avoid false negatives in CI.
- Exception handling and import issues were fixed for more reliable script and test execution.

### How to run tests in headless environments
- GUI-related tests will be skipped if no display is detected (e.g., on CI servers or remote shells).
- To run all tests, ensure a display is available (e.g., run locally on your desktop or use a virtual display on Linux).

### How to handle settings files
- The application expects a valid YAML settings file with all required keys. If the file is missing or invalid, a `RuntimeError` will be raised and should be handled appropriately.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-05-17

- All automated tests (UI and non-UI) now pass reliably on all supported platforms.
- UI tests are automatically skipped in headless environments (e.g., CI servers, remote shells).
- Theme Manager UI is fully stable, with all components covered by automated tests.
- Fixed duplicate/hidden Add Theme button logic and improved theme manager code structure.
- YAML config and theme file handling is now robust, with auto-fix and user prompt logic for broken/missing files.
- Documentation and developer comments updated for clarity and maintainability.

## Theme System and UI Structure (v2.0+)

### Theme Manager

- The Theme Manager tab in Settings is now the single place for all theme customization.
- You can create, edit, save, apply, and delete custom themes.
- Only custom themes are editable; built-in themes are read-only and cannot be overwritten.
- Custom themes are included in the main theme selector in the General tab.
- All theme changes are applied live, and only supported widgets are styled (no more errors for Menubar, Listbox, or Text styling).

### Removal of Colors Tab

- The previous Colors tab has been removed for simplicity and to avoid confusion.
- All color and theme customization is now centralized in the Theme Manager.

### How to Use

1. Open the Settings window from the menu.
2. Go to the Theme Manager tab.
3. Select or create a custom theme.
4. Edit widget/button colors as desired.
5. Save and apply your custom theme.
