3. **Open Rule Set** - Load rule sets from files
4. **Save Rule Set / Save As** - Save rule sets to files
5. **Import/Export Rules** - Import/export individual rules or rule sets

### Medium Priority
6. **Create Test Files** - Generate test files for rule testing
7. **Organization History** - Track and display past organization operations
8. **Recent Rule Sets** - Quick access to recently used rule sets

### Low Priority  
9. **Developer Log Window** - Show detailed logs for debugging
10. **Quick Start Guide** - Interactive tutorial for new users
11. **Documentation/Help** - Built-in help system

## Technical Architecture

### Package Structure
```
taskmover_redesign/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py          # Package initialization and exports
â””â”€â”€ app.py              # Main redesigned application

run_redesigned.py       # Runner script for testing new UI
```

### Integration Points
- **Rules**: Uses `taskmover.config` for loading/saving rules
- **Settings**: Uses `taskmover.ui_settings_helpers` for preferences
- **File Operations**: Uses `taskmover.file_operations` for organization
- **UI Components**: Uses `taskmover.ui_rule_helpers` for rule dialogs
- **Utilities**: Uses `taskmover.utils` for window centering and other helpers

### Key Classes
- `TaskMoverApp`: Main application class handling UI and coordination
- Inherits all backend functionality from existing TaskMover modules
- Clean separation between UI logic and business logic

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Feature**: Select which pending feature to implement next
2. **Implement Feature**: Add the functionality to the redesigned app
3. **Test Integration**: Ensure new features work with existing backend
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep this status document current

## Testing

To test the redesigned application:
```bash
python run_redesigned.py
```

The application will use your existing rules and settings, so you can immediately see your current TaskMover configuration in the new UI.
