## Development Philosophy

This project serves as a playground for effective AI-assisted development using tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude Sonnet. The development approach emphasizes:
- High code quality through comprehensive testing
- Clear documentation and architecture
- Iterative improvement and refactoring
- Learning and experimentation with AI tools

**Note**: This is an experimental project focusing on AI-assisted development. While we strive for production-quality code, this remains a work in progress and learning experience.
