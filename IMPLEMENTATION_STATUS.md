  - Full-featured pattern management interface
  - Searchable pattern grid with filtering
  - Pattern testing interface with live validation
  - Complete CRUD operations with modern dialogs
  - Usage tracking display

- **Enhanced Rule Editor** (`taskmover_redesign/ui/rule_components.py`)
  - Modern rule editing dialog with pattern integration
  - Pattern selection dropdown with library integration
  - Inline pattern creation capability
  - Save/Cancel buttons with unsaved changes detection
  - Full validation and error handling

### Integration (PARTIAL)
- **App Integration** (`taskmover_redesign/app.py`)
  - Pattern library and rule-pattern manager initialization
  - Pattern tab enabled in main notebook
  - Rule editor integration with pattern system
  - Cross-component communication setup

## ✅ Verified Working Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Pattern creation with UUID-based identification
- ✅ JSON persistence with modern data format

- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Modern Python patterns (dataclasses, type hints)
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ No backwards compatibility constraints

### Architecture
- ✅ Pattern library shared across all rulesets
- ✅ UUID-based relationships for data integrity
- ✅ Event-driven cross-component communication
- ✅ Modular, testable components

### User Experience
